# FTP-Miner

Sadly two of the previously included search engines are currently offline (last checked: 17. October 2018)
It looks like FileMare and Filewatcher have given up on their service.
Thus the current version of FTP-Miner includes the two remaining engines: Napalm and Mamont.

## How do I do the thing?

Clone the repo, initialize a new virtualenv, install the deps.

```
git clone https://github.com/doomnuggets/FTP-Miner.git
cd FTP-Miner
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ftpminer.py --help
```

Usage:

```
